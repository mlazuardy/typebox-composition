# Basic Usage

As we mentioned in the [Overview](/docs), type composition aimed to validate incoming data either from form input or within your HTTP Requests.

## Writing Schema / Rules

First, make sure you have create an `TypeComposition` instance that we mentioned in the [Installation Guide](/docs/installation).

Then create a schema / rules.

```ts
import { Type } from "@sinclair/typebox";

const schema = Type.Object({
  name: Type.String({ minLength: 1, maxLength: 50 }),
});
```

After that you can validate the using this schema from your incoming data using `.validate` method

```ts
import { type Static } from "@sinclair/typebox";
import { validator } from "./your-type-composition-instance";
// assumed you passed incoming data within this function
export function createUser(data: Static<typeof schema>) {
  const { errors } = validator.validate(schema, data);

  if (errors.length) {
    // errors will return Array-object with pre-formatted messages based on your `TypeComposition` options
  }

  // validation passed, creating user.
}
```

As you can see in the example above, if validation fails, we can check if `errors.length` is more than one.
- If you're using validation within backend like express, fastify etc. you can send the errors as well as error status `422`.
- in Browser / client like React, Vue etc. You can update your errors state and conditionally return the error component / tag.

## Validation Error Response Format
If validation fails, the `errors` will return like this:

```json
[
  {
    field: "name",
    kind: "String",
    path: "/name",
    message: "the name field must be at least 1 characters.",
  },
]
```

| Property  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| field  | Field that you've defined in your schema  |
| kind  | Typebox or custom type kind |
| path  | Typebox path, if schema is nested it will return /path/:nestedPath/:and so on  |
| message | pre-formatted message, or plain message if we dont covered the Type |

> For now, `@typeb/composition` only display first error for each properties.

## A Note On some Fields
Some fields may return different messages from what you expected.
Here is the list of the fields that return different messages from what you expected and how to adjust it.

### String
In some cases especially in client side validation (a form), an input may return an empty string (`""`).
When this happened and you have a `minLength` property inside your `Type.String` rule and the value you're trying to validate is an empty strign, the messages will return a `stringMin` validation.

If you preferred to return a `required` messages you can added `required` to true inside your `Type.String` validation.

```ts
const schema = Type.Object({
  name: Type.String({
    minLength: 1,
    // return`required` error message instead of `stringMin` when the value is empty string
    required: true
  })
})
```

Internally `@typeb/composition` will return a `required` error message instead of `stringMin`
