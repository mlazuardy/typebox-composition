# Overview

## Why
Typebox Composition aimed to validate incoming data either from `<form>` input or HTTP Requests,
with pre-formatted validation messages so your user will understand about the errors messages come from the validation.

## Limitations
We only format Standarad Types

here is the list pre-formatted Standard Types that we covered:
- `Type.String`
- `Type.Number`
- `Type.Boolean`
- `Type.Array`
- `Type.Object`
- `Type.Enum (Literal / Union)`

Beside the JSON Types listed above we also have useful custom types, you can check [Available Custom Types Here](/docs/custom-types).

We may added more JSON Types or even other / extended types from `typebox` when needed.
