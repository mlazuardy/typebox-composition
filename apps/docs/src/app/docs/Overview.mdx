# Overview

## Typebox
According to [Typebox](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox) repository.
TypeBox is a runtime type builder that creates in-memory JSON Schema objects that can be statically inferred as TypeScript types. The schemas produced by this library are designed to match the static type assertion rules of the TypeScript language. TypeBox allows one to create a unified type that can be statically checked by TypeScript and runtime asserted using standard JSON Schema validation.

The library is designed to enable JSON schema to compose with the same flexibility as TypeScript's type system. It can be used as a simple tool to build up complex schemas or integrated into REST or RPC services to help validate data received over the wire.

## Typebox Validator
Typebox is quite fast and maybe the fastest `JSON` schema validation in javascript world.
But it (for now) does not provide custom `error messages` and internationalization (i18n).

We can still customize the error by filtering `Kind` or `type` return from its `ValueError` value.
However you will end up writing this custom messages over and again if you use typebox in many projects.
So that's why `Typebox Validator` created to end it all.

here is the different between typebox default messages and our typebox-validator:

## Limitations
`TypeboxValidator` aimed to validate data defined inside `Type.Object`.

although `Typebox Validator` already format the messages,
we only pre-formatted the messages only for Standard Types because for now this package focuses on validating data that is usually live within form input (browser/client) or API.

here is the list Standard Types we covered:
- Type.String
- Type.Number
- Type.Array
- Type.Object
- Type.Enum / Literal / Union

we may added more Standard Types or even other / extended types from `typebox` when needed.
