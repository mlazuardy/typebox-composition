# Custom Types

Since `typebox` does not provide custom types, we provide useful custom types that oftenly used within your form or http request validation such as `email` `url` etc.

Here is the list of Available Custom Types:

## Email
The field under validation must be formatted as an email address.

```ts
import { Type } from "@sinclair/typebox";
import { TypeEmail } from "@typeb/composition";

const schema = Type.Object({
  email: TypeEmail(),
});
```

## ObjectId
Validate against mongodb BSON / ObjectId.

```ts
import { Type } from "@sinclair/typebox";
import { TypeObjectId } from "@typeb/composition";

const schema = Type.Object({
  userId: TypeObjectId(),
});
```
